		 360 * Height * TanB
Angle = ----------------------------------
	  Module * Number of Teeth * Pi



Height (gear thickness)
TanB (B is the helix angle; between upright tooth and slanted tooth eg |/ )
   --> In other words, the angle at which you want the gears to intersect
   --> For perpendicular gears B will be 45 degrees, therefore TanB will be 1
Module (pitch diameter / number of teeth)

You may need to halve the resulting angle for the twist function in Fusion 360,
	height sometimes only comes out as half of what you call for.
